          <p>ABSTRACT:Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common chronic disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. As a first step towards creating patient supporting social network, this work aims to visually present and monitor the patient's health situation and treatment. As a result, a web-based prototype application is designed and implemented to facilitate rapid access to the patient data with the goal of reducing provider cognitive burden. The data is collected by reviewing consecutive medical records of adult patients with severe OSA. We categorize these data and organize them into suitable visual representations considering perceptual principles and design guidelines. The research contribution includes (1) a well-reasoned justification of how existing information visualization techniques can be usefully combined to present medical data; (2) the visual encoding and interaction mechanisms of comparing a given quantitative measurements against qualitative ranges, which is applicable to various domains in presenting laboratory test results.</p>

This paper aims to make sense of nanomaterial toxicity publication and keywords data through quantitative metrics and network visualization. We have adapted a combined approaches of network analysis, co-occurrence analysis, clustering analysis and visual analytics, to characterize important relational properties of network structures and features of entities. The results show that both co-authorship network and keywords network on nanomaterial toxicity follow the power-law degree distribution. In addition, the co-authorship network appears to be of scale-free pattern. We also investigate and visualize the research trends in field of nanomaterial toxicity by studying top influence researchers and keywords over years. These findings offer researchers various insights of the patterns and trends in the nanomaterial toxicity.</p>

          <p> ABSTRACT:
            NEIMiner is an integrated information system for studying the nanomaterial environmental impact (NEI). However, there is a lack of visual analytic tools that efficiently query and present large-scaled bibliography meta-data and NEI characterizations in a meaningful way. This paper presents the design and implementation efforts of developing the information visualization (InfoVis) module for NEIMiner. We first describe a user centered design approach to identify the analysis tasks, to select suitable visual representations, and to iteratively validate and improve the development. We then show that how existing techniques, such as graph simplification, enriched visualization algorithms and interactive features, can be usefully combined to aid users gaining insights. We demonstrate the utility of InfoVis through scenarios of constructing co-authorship network, bibliography keywords network, and nanomaterial terms co-occurrence network. We implement our techniques as a Drupal module. Our design is supportive for analysts and researchers to identify concepts and relationships in studying environmental impact of nanomaterial.

          <p>ABSTRACT:
The Scalable Multi-Scale Visual Analytical Tool (SMS-VAT) for Advancing Translational Sciences aims to facilitate the translation of generated knowledge into applied clinical practice using interactive visualization. The platform consists of three components: (1) heterogeneous information extraction and mining for translational science, (2) integration of cubing architecture with powerful visualization, and (3) enhanced multi-scale visual analytics. We propose a taxonomy model that provides a high level of Data â€“ Visualization â€“ Translation Science mapping pipeline directly mapped domain knowledge with various data types and semantics to visual techniques for encoding data in a graphic. We create a typical use scenario with standardized reporting methods such as forest plot, Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator, and STROBE for clinical decision making: intraoperative transfusion â€“ which focuses on the anesthesia patient safety.

          <p>We introduced the concept of "Flu Cloud" which presented a spatial visualization of the Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) based on the results of density-based clustering. The proposed Flu Cloud is like the weather map produced by satellites in weather forecasting: it maps the flu related tweets with coordinates into density based clusters for the general population. Public available tweets streaming provides the possibility of updating the Flu Cloud in near real time. In the long term, detecting the movement of the Flu Cloud over time helps the understanding and prediction of the dynamic trends of Influenza in high-resolution.</p>

          <p>The intersection of Atherton St. and Railroad Ave. in State College, PA was identified as a high-risk intersection due to a large pedestrian volume, accident rates and a current crossing design that encourages risky pedestrian behavior. Several factors influence a pedestrian's crossing behavior and the choice to adhere to crossing regulations. Risky crossing behavior compromises the safety of both pedestrians and motorists. The study aims to capture, code and analyze pedestrian crossing behavior at the Atherton/Railroad intersection. After identifying the predominant types of behavior and the highest density crossing times, the design Committee proposed design alternatives to support pedestrian adherence to crossing regulations and potentially reduce accidents.</p>

          <p>This study investigates the factors that affect movement and tracking mouse cursor in computer-based work with multi-monitors. The study aims to explore how the display objects' width, amplitude, and gap distance between dual monitors affect movement time of mouse cursor. The objectives also include identifying potential obstacles within the multi-monitor working places. A within-subjects experiment involving five subjects was designed and conducted to access the performance of the participants in one dimensional pointing-and-clicking task. We applied regression analysis and the analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to analyze the factorial design. The results of the pilot study show that the physical gap distance is a potential obstacle within the multi-monitor work places of screens. In addition, we applied the regression models in different forms and compare their fitness. The results show that the modified Fitts' law model with obstacle component, as compare with the original Fitts' law model, provides a better fit for the movement time in all presented levels of gaps between the dual monitors.</p>

          <p>Given the increase in number of women involved with farming and gardening activities and the lack of women-optimized tools in the market, this study examines the design of a wheel hoe for women.  The following table demonstrates the static design and adjustable design measurements suggested by the study. A prototype was tested by 12 females. This preference data was correlated to various anthropometric measures and expanded in a hybrid model using both NHANES and ANSUR databases.  Recommendations take into account the accommodation of the central 95% of the target population. While the study is limited in the number of participants, the tested posture, and the subsequent model correlation, it is believed that this study guides preliminary development of a wheel hoe designed specifically for women.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACT:In distributed and scalable virtual test,virtual equipments located in multiple nodes are connected together by local and wide area network to complete the virtual testing tasks for advanced equipments.During the process of testing task,each participating node has to send corresponding state and data to the others through the test platform.Therefore,it calls for a data exchange mechanism which can effectively support the running of virtual test system.This study describes a multi-node information exchange mechanism,which aims at achieving layered communication management,eliminating tightly coupled communication and reducing redundant information transmission.The work presented focuses on several aspects including hierarchical architecture,theme-based publish/subscribe paradigm and reliable unicast / local multicast combined communication,which can meet the actual needs in virtual test.</p>

          <p>The project is to determine the adjustability of the seat in SAE Class-B heavy truck based on Digital Human Model (DHM) Jack, considering the accommodations in headroom, legroom and visibility. H-point represents the approximate location of the seat where the driver's hips would be located. After obtaining the nine DHM in a range of stature and mass (5th,50th,95th Stature, 5th,50th,95th Mass), the next stop is to fit the model in the Class-B heavy truck cab. Taking all the data that collected in the Jack 5.1 system, in figure 2, the area in the red box is the range of adjustability of the H-point in both the vertical and horizontal directions for SAE Class-B heavy truck.</p>

          <p>In this project, we present a prototype design of iphone calendar application, named MicroCal, for young people and teenagers. We provide a user-friendly approach of interaction to create a customized user experience.  The design of dial interface makes it different from the regular calendar in appearance which creates a fashionable and customized users interface. The design concepts also take advantage of the multi-touch technology to simplify the interaction. You may notice that the similar layout we proposed in 2009 is now widely used in <a href="https://www.android.com/wear/"> smartwatch </a> </p>
